# Testnet

**Note: Currently the only thing you can do on Testnet is buy the BIT10.DEFI token, you can't transfer it as the fee's are too high but an update will soon fix this, where the user will be able to transfer their tokens from one person to another and swap back into BIT10.BTC as well as any other Cypto Token.**

Please make sure you have signed up to the Testnet before the deadline.\
There may still be spaces available, keep an eye out on BIT10 Twitter page.\
